While chroot is a pretty old technology, it is still in use today by some popular software projects. Container technologies that we have today still embody this very concept, but in a modernized version and with a lot of features on top.

To isolate a process even more than chroot can do, current Linux kernels provide features like namespaces and cgroups.

Namespaces are used to isolate various resources, for example the network. A network namespace can be used to provide a complete abstraction of network interfaces and routing tables. This allows a process to have its own IP address. The Linux Kernel 5.6 currently provides 8 namespaces:

pid - process ID provides a process with its own set of process IDs.
net - network allows the processes to have their own network stack, including the IP address.
mnt - mount abstracts the filesystem view and manages mount points.
ipc - inter-process communication provides separation of named shared memory segments.
user - provides process with their own set of user IDs and group IDs.
uts - Unix time sharing allows processes to have their own hostname and domain name.
cgroup - a newer namespace that allows a process to have its own set of cgroup root directories.
time - the newest namespace can be used to virtualize the clock of the system.
